This repository contains my daily solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that I solve on platforms like GeeksforGeeks (GFG) and LeetCode.
It serves as my personal practice log, a structured collection of problem-solving approaches, and a quick reference for revision.

🎯 Goals

Solve DSA problems daily 🗓️

Improve problem-solving skills & coding efficiency ⚡

Build a comprehensive reference repo for revision & interview prep 💼
